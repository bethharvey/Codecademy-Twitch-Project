# Codecademy-Twitch-Project

This is a semi-guided project through the Codecademy Data Science Inference Specialty career path. The goal of the project is to analyze fictional data from Twitch streams using SQL, then visualize the data using matplotlib. 

A selected subset of the data was provided by Codecademy for the visualization portion. I completed the objectives using that data, then again using the data from my SQL queries.

Raw data: chat.csv and stream.csv

SQL database: twitch.db

SQL queries: twitch.sqbdpro

Python code: Twitch Data Visualization Project.ipynb
